Using CSS Properties to Create Apple Pay Buttons
使用CSS属性创建苹果公司支付按钮

In iOS 10.1, you can use new CSS properties to create the same Apple Pay buttons for your website 
that you create for native apps.

For example, to display the standard Apple Pay button that has a black background, set the 
-webkit-appearance CSS property of an element to -apple-pay-button. Note that the minimum size of
this button matches the size of the button you can create using the PKPaymentButton API. You can 
also specify the standard button appearances by setting the -apple-pay-button-style CSS property to 
white, white-outline, or black.

To create different button types, such as plain or set-up, set the -apple-pay-button-type to plain, 
buy, or set-up.

You can also set the language of an Apple Pay button by setting the -webkit-locale CSS property or 
the lang HTML attribute. For example, to display a button with the text "Buy with Apple Pay" in French, 
you can use code like this:

```
    <button lang="fr" style="-webkit-appearance: -apple-pay-button; -apple-pay-button-type: buy;">
    </button>

```
