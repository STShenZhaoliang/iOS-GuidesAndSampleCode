Apple Pay

The PassKit framework adds support for payment passes and payment requests. Payment requests let users securely provide you with their payment and contact information to pay for physical goods and services. Payment passes are added to Passbook by payment networks, such as credit card issuers and banks, and let the user select their account on that payment network to fund payments.

For more information, see Pass Kit Framework Reference.
