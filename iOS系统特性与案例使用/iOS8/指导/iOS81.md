Apple Pay

The PassKit framework adds support for payment passes and payment requests. Payment requests let users securely provide you with their payment and contact information to pay for physical goods and services. Payment passes are added to Passbook by payment networks, such as credit card issuers and banks, and let the user select their account on that payment network to fund payments.

For more information, see Pass Kit Framework Reference.

苹果支付

PassKit框架增加了支付通行证和付款请求的支持。 付款请求可让用户安全地为您提供付款和联系信息，以支付实物商品和服务。 付款通行证由支付网络（如信用卡发卡机构和银行）添加到“存折”中，并让用户选择其在该支付网络上的帐户来支付款项。
